# MemeBot
This is a simple Discord Bot that is able to generate random memes from Reddit!

Here is the [tutorial](https://www.codedex.io/projects/build-a-discord-bot-with-python) I followed.

Currently, this bot will respond as long as the program is kept running in the background (i.e. your terminal). The next step is to have the program running all the time in an actual server!
